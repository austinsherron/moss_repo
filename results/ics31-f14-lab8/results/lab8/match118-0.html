"""
This program will keep track of the rooms available for rent (these
vary, since sometimes a room is closed for redecoration) and the
reservations that guests have made for these rooms.

# STAGE 1 ==================================================================
"""Keeps track of the rooms that are available.

Commands:

bedroom") followed by an integer room number (in the range 1â€“999). Add a
new bedroom with the specified room number.

BL
(for "bedroom list"). Print a list of the bedrooms currently
available. The input file may contain any number of these commands in
any order; each BL command prints a list of available bedrooms based on
what has been added as of that point. See the sample output below for
the format of the printed bedroom list. For this stage, it doesn't
matter what order the bedrooms appear in.

PL
(for "print line"), followed by any text. Simply print (or "echo") a
line, copying the input (not counting the PL and leading whitespace) to
the output. You'll find it useful in testing, and it's also a simple way

to make the program's reports clearer or fancier.

**
Comment, followed by any text. Like comments in a program, comment
lines don't have any effect on the program's behavior; they just serve
as annotations in the command file.
